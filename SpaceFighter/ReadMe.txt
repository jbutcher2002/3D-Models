Space Fighter for P3D/FSX

Model, and VC by Comrade1280 (https://sketchfab.com/comrade1280)

Guns and weapons system work with P3D pro version. Weapons guage
is in the panel. Reworked the refueling guage to track AI aircraft.
It sends the tracking information to the auto pilot, and will get within
a half a mile of target. (Fun For Guns).

Flight model based on X-35 from fs09. VTOL is activated by flaps.
I think I put in 5 or 6 flap settings. Flaps full down is VTOL. Flaps
up one produces foreward thrust. Flaps up full is full thrust, and 
will max out at mach 4.6  Rudder is touchie at speed, but such is 
the price for VTOL in P3D. Kelly's auto ILS aproach guage, sim rate,
and auto pilot guages all work, but are being replaced by newer avionics.

Virtual Cockpit is work in progress. Im adding animated controls, 
afterburner effects, landing gear, and the F-111 ground following
radar. Im reworking some guages from version 5, and FS2020 to make 
the VC one of the most realistic.
